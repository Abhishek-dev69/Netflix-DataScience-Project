# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of Netflix content to uncover insights about movies and TV shows available on the platform. Using Python and popular data analysis libraries, the project analyzes trends related to **genres, ratings, vote averages, and content distribution**.

The goal of this project is to practice **real-world data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation** from a large dataset.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

* The dataset contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows.
* Key columns include:

  * Title
  * Genre
  * Vote Average
  * Release information
  * Type (Movie / TV Show)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
* **NumPy** – Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

---

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

* Cleaned and preprocessed raw Netflix data
* Categorized the `vote_average` column into meaningful rating buckets
* Split and exploded genre data to analyze individual genres
* Answered important analytical questions such as:

  * 📊 Most frequent genres on Netflix
  * ⭐ Content with the highest vote averages
  * 🎥 Genre-wise distribution of movies
* Created clear and informative visualizations to support insights

---

## 📈 Visualizations

The project includes multiple visualizations to make trends easy to understand:

* Genre distribution charts
* Vote average comparisons
* Frequency analysis plots

These visuals help identify **popular genres** and **highly-rated content** on Netflix.

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings

* Hands-on experience with **EDA workflows**
* Improved understanding of **data cleaning techniques**
* Practical use of **data visualization for storytelling**
* Handling real-world datasets with missing and complex values
